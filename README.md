# AI-Generated Nuclei Templates

> Before we dive into the details, We want to highlight our [templates leaderboard](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/templates/leaderboard) for the community and the [Nuclei Templates Community Rewards Program](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/Community-Rewards-FAQ.md). You can learn more about these initiativesÂ [here](https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/announcing-the-nuclei-templates-community-leaderboard-and-rewards). We are currently running a program where we send stickers to all first-time contributors. This is a great opportunity to pick an AI-generated template, review it, set up a vulnerable environment, and submit a pull request with the debug data for our team to review on [nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates). In addition to this, we plan to send swag to our top contributors each month.

> Note: The templates are AI-generated, so many may have invalid or contain incorrect matchers or request data. We strongly discourage running them as-is. These templates are intended for use by us and the community to review, validate, and contribute to the nuclei-templates project.

## Overview
This repository contains Nuclei templates generated by AI for newly disclosed CVEs not yet covered by existing templates, aimed at enhancing detection speed and coverage. These templates are produced by our AI workflow and are preliminary, they may contain errors such as false positives, weak matchers, and other inaccuracies.

Automating the generation of Nuclei templates allows our team to focus more on validating and refining these templates rather than creating them from scratch. We invite the community to assist in validating these templates, refining them, and contributing by submitting pull requests to the nuclei-templates repository. This collaborative effort is key to expanding coverage for CVE scanning and contributing to a safer internet.

## How It Works
- **CVE Monitoring**: We continuously monitor for new CVE disclosures.
- **Template Generation**: Using ProjectDiscoveryAI, we generate preliminary Nuclei templates based on these CVEs.

## Disclaimer
### Warning: Preliminary Templates
The templates in this repository are automatically generated by AI and are intended for demonstration and development purposes only. They **should not be used in production environments without thorough validation**. These templates are not fully vetted and may not function as intended, serving primarily to showcase AI capabilities. They **must be manually reviewed and tested before use**.

## How to Contribute
Your contributions can help improve the quality and coverage of these templates. Review the templates, refine them, and submit your enhancements via pull requests to the nuclei-templates repository. Your efforts will help us cover more CVEs and contribute to a safer internet for everyone.
