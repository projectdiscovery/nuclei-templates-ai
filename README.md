# AI-Generated Nuclei Templates 👾

> This project is an implementation of our vision detailed in [From CVE to Template: The Future of Automating Nuclei Templates with AI](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/future-of-automating-nuclei-templates-with-ai/)

This repository demonstrates the power of AI in automating security template generation for vulnerability detection. Using ProjectDiscoveryAI API, we automatically generate Nuclei templates for newly disclosed CVEs and existing vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Showcase AI capabilities in security tooling automation
- Generate templates for latest CVEs not yet covered in nuclei-templates
- Present the challenge of template verification to the community

## ⚠️ Important Note

These templates are AI-generated and **not verified**. They serve as:
- Proof of concept for AI capabilities
- Starting point for template development
- Learning resource for the community

**Do not use these templates in production without thorough validation.**

## 🤝 Community Challenge

The main challenge we face is automated verification of generated templates. We welcome:
- Ideas for automating template verification
- Contributions to improve template accuracy
- Novel approaches to validate generated templates

## 🏆 Get Involved

> Try our [Nuclei Template AI Editor](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/templates) to experiment with AI-powered template generation!

> Join our [templates leaderboard](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/templates/leaderboard) and participate in the [Nuclei Templates Community Rewards Program](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/Community-Rewards-FAQ.md). First-time contributors receive stickers, and top monthly contributors get special swag!


## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Monitor**: Continuous tracking of new CVE disclosures
2. **Generate**: AI-powered template creation
3. **Validate**: Community-driven verification process

## 🚀 Next Steps

Help us bridge the gap between AI generation and production-ready templates by:
- Reviewing and validating templates
- Suggesting improvements to the AI generation process
- Contributing verified templates to the main [nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) repository
